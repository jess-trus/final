Cardiovascular disease or heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease. From WHO statistics, every year, 17.9 million die from heart disease

The Cleveland dataset was defined, cleaned, and analyzed to answer pertinent questions that are vital to human life as regards the possibility of a heart attack. This dataset stemmed from a survey donated on 7/1/1988. However, this could serve as a template for learning why individuals could have a heart attack. We plan on using the heart attack prediction dataset to create multiple machine learning models, and then analyze which model performs best.
